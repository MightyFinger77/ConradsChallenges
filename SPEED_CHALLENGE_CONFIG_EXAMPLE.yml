# Example SPEED Challenge Configuration (New System)
# 
# The old speed tier rewards (reward-commands in tiers) are NO LONGER USED
# Speed tiers are only used to determine multipliers (Gold=1.5x, Silver=1.0x, Bronze=0.5x)
# Actual rewards come from difficulty-tier-rewards

# How it works:
# 
# 1. Speed Tiers (completion.tiers):
#    - Still needed to determine which speed tier player achieved
#    - Gold (≤90s) = 1.5x multiplier
#    - Silver (≤180s) = 1.0x multiplier (normal)
#    - Bronze (≤300s) = 0.5x multiplier (half)
#    - reward-commands in tiers are IGNORED
#
# 2. Difficulty Tier Rewards (difficulty-tier-rewards):
#    - Easy: Base rewards (1.0x difficulty multiplier)
#    - Medium: Gets Easy rewards (×1.5) + Medium rewards (×1.0)
#    - Hard: Gets Easy (×3.0) + Medium (×2.0) + Hard (×1.0)
#    - Extreme: Gets all previous (×9.0, ×6.0, ×3.0) + Extreme (×1.0)
#    - Speed multiplier is then applied on top:
#      * Gold time: ×1.5
#      * Silver time: ×1.0
#      * Bronze time: ×0.5
#      * New record: ×3.0 (replaces speed tier multiplier)
#
# 3. Top Time Rewards (top-time-rewards):
#    - Only given when player sets a new record
#    - Gets 3x multiplier (difficulty multiplier still applies)
#
# Example:
# - Player completes on Medium difficulty, Gold time (60s), new record:
#   - Gets: Easy rewards (×1.5 difficulty × 3.0 record = 4.5x) + Medium rewards (×1.0 difficulty × 3.0 record = 3.0x)
#   - Plus: Top time rewards (×1.5 difficulty × 3.0 record = 4.5x)
